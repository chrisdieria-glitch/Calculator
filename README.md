Welcome! This is a **desktop calculator built in Python using Tkinter**.  
It allows you to perform basic and advanced operations with a simple and clean graphical interface.

- Advanced operations: **exponent (^)**  
- Supports **decimal numbers**  
- **History panel** displays all performed operations  
  - Can be shown or hidden easily  
- **Clear buttons**:
